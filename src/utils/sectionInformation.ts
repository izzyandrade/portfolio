       when I was already in love with videogames, and movies with cool effects. When I was 18, I joined college in a
       Software Development course. Since then, I also went through a Nanodegree in Full Stack Web Development, and another one in Cloud DevOps, both ministrated by Udacity.
       Today, my goals are to follow the road in Software Architecture, DevOps, and Blockchain. I have worked in some awesome companies from my country,
       and I appreciate every opportunity I had because it made me grow as a better developer and as a better person. Today, I work in a company called Cheesecake Labs, a Software House that builds incredible digital solutions and aims to deliver a WOOOOW service.`,

      . Feel free to share content, ask me anything, and talk about any areas of technology.`,
